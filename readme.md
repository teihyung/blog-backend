# Getting Started with Backend API built with Node.js, Express.js and TypeScript
This is a simple backend API built with Node.js, Express.js and TypeScript. 

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- Docker (optional)
- Supabase

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the server
4. The server will be running on `http://localhost:8000`
5. You can test the API using Postman or any other API testing tool

## running scripts for docker
1. run chmod +x rebuild.sh (Make script executable)
